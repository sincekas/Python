Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x,y,z and n representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an n integer . Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n. Here, . Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.

Input Format

Four integers  and , each on a separate line.

Constraints

Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.

------------------------------------------------
x, y, z, n = (int(input()) for _ in range(4))

print ([[a,b,c] for a in range(x+1) for b in range(y+1) for c in range(z+1) if a + b + c != n ])
